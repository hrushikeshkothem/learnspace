# Challenges of Hashing

Consider we are using hashing for database sharding.

now a data input is given to a hash function and the hash value is calucated.
depending on the hash value we choose which database to select to store the data.

example

 data -> hash function -> hash value ( 8 ) 
 say, we have 4 databases.

 now we can apply the modulo operation to the hash value to get the database number.
 that means , 8 % 4 = 0
 so it stores in the 0th database. which is the first database.

similarly, if the hash value is 9 then 9 % 4 = 1
so it stores in the 2nd database.

and soon.... 

but , what if out 4 databases a database is down.
then the hash value 7 % 4 = 3 and which choose the 4th database.
and it is down.

now we need to rewrire the hash function to choose the next database.
which is total mess and chaos.

this is one of the challenges of hashing.

and for this purpose we can use consistent hashing.
