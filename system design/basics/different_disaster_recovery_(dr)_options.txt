# Different Disaster Recovery (DR) Options

Disaster recovery options 

    1. backup and restore
    2. pilot light
    3. warm standby
    4. active - active

1. Backup and Restore
    - Data is backed up to a secondary location and can be restored in the event of a disaster.
    - RPO and RTO depend on the frequency of backups and the time taken to restore the data.
    - Suitable for small-scale applications with low RPO and RTO requirements.

2. Pilot Light
    - A minimal version of the application is always running in the cloud.
    - In the event of a disaster, the full application can be quickly launched.
    - Suitable for applications with moderate RPO and RTO requirements.
    - Cost-effective compared to other options.

3. Warm Standby
    - A scaled-down version of the application is always running in the cloud.
    - In the event of a disaster, the full application can be scaled up.
    - Suitable for applications with higher RPO and RTO requirements.
    - More expensive than the pilot light option.

4. Active - Active
    - Two identical versions of the application are running simultaneously in different locations.
    - In the event of a disaster, traffic can be redirected to the secondary location.
    - Suitable for applications with very low RPO and RTO requirements.
    - Most expensive option due to the need for duplicate infrastructure.
