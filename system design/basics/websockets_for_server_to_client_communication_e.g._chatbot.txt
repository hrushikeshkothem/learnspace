# Websockets for Server to Client Communication e.g. Chatbot

## Websockets

Consider a simple serverless 

User -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB

here the user invokes the server , and this is a good fit 
incase of fetching transaction data, or order request this is a good fit.

but what if the server wants to send a message to the user.

eg : a chatbot, or a notification.

in that case we can use websockets.

## Websockets

websockets are build above the http protocol.
and it keeps the connection open between the server and the client.
and when we use websockets the server can send a message to the client.
and the client can send a message to the server.
