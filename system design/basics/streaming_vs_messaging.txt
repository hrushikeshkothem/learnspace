# Streaming vs Messaging

## Streaming

1. In streaming, the data is processed in real-time.
2. For example take amazon website 
    for every click on the website the data will be processed in real-time.
3. The data will be processed in a sequence.
4. The data will be processed in real-time.
5. So alot of data will be sent to the server.
6. Process a single click won't make sense 
7. So we collect all the click in a session and push it to the amazon kinsis. or some 
    amazon messaging streaming service. MSK ( Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka ) 
8. The data will be processed in real-time.
9. The data won't be deletd from the stream. unless we delete it.
10. The data will be available for all the consumers.
11. The data will be processed by all the consumers.

## Messaging

1. In messaging, the data is simple json or xml data.
2. The data will be processed by pushing into a simple queue service. ( SQS )
3. The data will be pulled by the backend and will be processed.
4. The data will be deleted from the queue after processing if it is SQS 
5. The data won't be deleted if it is some publish subscribe system.

Difference:
1. Streaming is a real-time processing, Messaging is a simple data processing.
2. Streaming is a sequence processing, Messaging is a parallel processing.
3. Streaming is a keep message, Messaging is a delete message.
4. Streaming is a message will be available for all the consumers, Messaging is a message will be processed by only one consumer.
etc...

example:
Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service.
Kafka is a streaming service.
SQS is a messaging service.
SNS is a messaging service.
