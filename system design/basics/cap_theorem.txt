# CAP Theorem

C - Consistency
A - Availability
P - Partition Tolerance

Whenever a network partition occurs, you have to choose between consistency and availability.

If you choose consistency, you have to wait until the partition is resolved to read or write data. 
If you choose availability, you can read and write data, but you might read stale data or write data that will be lost.

Partition tolerance is a must-have in distributed systems, so you have to choose between consistency and availability.

This is known as the CAP theorem, which states that in a distributed system, you can only have two of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

For example, in a distributed system, you can have consistency and partition tolerance, but you might not have availability during a network partition.

Or you can have availability and partition tolerance, but you might not have consistency.

Or you can have consistency and availability, but you might not have partition tolerance.
