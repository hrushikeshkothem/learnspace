# High Availability

High availability is a Characteristics of a system, 
    which is designed to be available and operational for a high percentage of the time.

Consider a simple three tier architecture system

client -> load balancer -> service -> database

step 1 : is identifying the single point of failure in the system.

in the above case they are 
1. load balancer
2. service
3. database

step 2 : is to make the single point of failure redundant.

in the above case we can have
1. Most of the times the load balancer is provided by the cloud provider and they are highly available.
2. We can have multiple instances of the service running in different availability zones. 
    so that if one availability zone goes down the other availability zone can handle the traffic.
    and also if it a ec2 instance we can have auto scaling group to scale up and down based on the traffic.
3. We can have a read replica of the database in different availability zones.
    so that if one availability zone goes down the other availability zone can handle the traffic.
    and also if it a rds instance we can have read replicas to scale up and down based on the traffic.

step 3 : is to monitor the system.

we can use cloudwatch to monitor the system.
we can set up alarms for the system.
we can set up notifications for the alarms.

step 4 : is to test the system.

in the above case we can have a chaos engineering tool to test the system.

step 5 : is to have a disaster recovery plan.
 
int the above case we can have a backup of the database in different regions.

hence the system is highly available.
