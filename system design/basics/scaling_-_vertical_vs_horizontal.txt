# Scaling - Vertical vs Horizontal

Let say we have a application 
1. Which is running on a single server with 4 CPU and 16 GB RAM.
2. The application is getting more traffic and the server is not able to handle the traffic.
3. We have two options to scale the application.
    1. Vertical scaling
    2. Horizontal scaling

## Vertical scaling
1. In vertical scaling, we increase the capacity of the server.
2. We can increase the CPU, RAM, Disk etc ...
3. We can increase the CPU from 4 to 8, RAM from 16 GB to 32 GB etc ...
4. The application will be down for some time while increasing the capacity of the server.
5. The cost of vertical scaling is high.
6. The server will have a limit to increase the capacity.
7. The server will have a single point of failure.
8. The server will have a downtime while increasing the capacity.

## Horizontal scaling
1. In horizontal scaling, we increase the number of servers.
2. We can add more servers to the application to handle the traffic.
3. The application will be up and running while adding more servers.
4. The cost of horizontal scaling is low.
5. The application can scale horizontally to any number of servers.
6. The application will have a high availability.
7. The application will have a zero downtime while adding more servers.
8. The application can be scaled up and down based on the traffic.
