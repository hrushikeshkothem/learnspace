# Database Sharding

Database sharding is a method of splitting and storing a single logical dataset in multiple databases. 
Each shard is a database, 
and is referred to as a shard. 
Each shard is held on a separate database server instance to spread the load.

Sharding is necessary when the data set becomes too large to be stored in a single database.

Monolithic databases are not able to handle the load of large-scale applications.

Monolithic DB  -> Sharding

Sharding is a database architecture pattern related to horizontal partitioning 
— the practice of separating one table’s rows into multiple different tables, 
known as partitions.
