# High Availability vs Fault Tolerance

A fault tolerant system is a system that can continue to operate even 
    if one or more of its components fail.
    without compromising the system's performance.
    and without losing the data.

the main difference between high available system and fault tolerant system is 
    high available system is designed to be available and operational for a high percentage of the time.
    fault tolerant system is designed to be operational even if one or more of its components fail without,
    compromising the performance.

consider a system
                          |--------------------|
client -> load balancer ->| service            |-> database
                          |--------------------|

backend service is a fault tolerant system.
    if the database goes down the service can still operate.
    if the service goes down the client can still operate.
    without compromising the performance.

generally, fault tolerance systems are more expensive than high availability systems.
    because fault tolerance systems have to be designed to handle the failure of the components.
    and also have to be designed to handle the performance of the system.
