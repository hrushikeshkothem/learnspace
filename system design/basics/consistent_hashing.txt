# Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to distribute data across multiple servers. 
It is used to solve the problem of distributing data across a cluster of servers while minimizing the number of relocations when the cluster size changes. 
It is also used in caching, load balancing, and P2P networks.

Intially it considers all the servers in the cluster as points on a circle.

When a new data item is added to the system, a hash function is used to map the data item to a point on the circle.

and the server next to the point when travelled in clockwise direction is selected as the server to store the data item.

When a server is removed from the cluster, the data items that were stored on that server are re-mapped to the next server in the clockwise direction.

This way, consistent hashing minimizes the number of relocations when the cluster size changes, making it an efficient way to distribute data across multiple servers.

cons : 
    this could cause uneven distribution of data across servers.
    To solve this, virtual nodes can be used, where each physical server is represented by multiple virtual nodes on the circle. This helps distribute the data more evenly across the servers.

examples :
    Cassandra, Riak, and Memcached are some of the systems that use consistent hashing to distribute data across multiple servers.
