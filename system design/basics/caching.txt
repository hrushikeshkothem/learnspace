# Caching

Caching is a technique used to store copies of resources that are expensive to generate. 
This can be used to speed up the application by reducing the number of requests made to the server. 
Caching can be done at different levels, such as the browser, server, or database.

## Browser Caching
1. In browser caching, the browser stores the resources locally.
2. The browser will check the cache before making a request to the server.
3. The browser will store the resources in the cache based on the cache-control header.

## Server Caching
1. In server caching, the server stores the resources locally.
2. The server will check the cache before generating the resources.
3. The server will store the resources in the cache based on the cache-control header.

## Database Caching
1. In database caching, the database stores the query results locally.
2. The database will check the cache before executing the query.
3. The database will store the query results in the cache based on the query.

## Types of Caching
1. In-memory caching
2. Distributed caching
3. Object caching
4. Page caching
5. Query caching
etc ...

## Benefits of Caching
1. Faster response time
2. Reduced server load
3. Improved user experience
4. Reduced network traffic
5. Improved application performance
6. Reduced database load
7. Reduced latency
8. Improved scalability
9. Reduced cost
