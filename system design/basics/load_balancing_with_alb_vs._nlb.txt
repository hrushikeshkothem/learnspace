# Load Balancing with ALB Vs. NLB

-> every ec2 instance have a public ip address 
     and we can access our services from that ipaddress
     what if the ec2 instance got down and the ipaddress changes 
     what if you need to auto scale it horizantally 
     in that senoiros we can't relay on a ec2 instance ip address to access the services

in this senario Load Balancer comes to screen

Elastic load Balancer automatically distrubtes traffic to multiple instances
each elastic load Balancer have a unique name 

                                                        -> [ Amazon EC2 ]
[ Amazon Route53 ] -> [ Application Load Balancer ]     -> [ Amazon EC2 ]
                                                        -> [ Amazon EC2 ]

-> it also tracks the instance health , even if one service is down than it won't send traffic to that
    service

Properties of load Balancer:
    1. distrubes incomeing traffic
    2. Monitors health of traffic
    3. Integerate SSL
    4. It can scale up and down ( elastic )


Types of load Balancer
    1. Application load Balancer
    2. Network load Balancer

    1. -> you want to invoke different backend for different routes than 
        with application load balancer using the path you can distrubtes the traffic
        becuase of this we can scale each backend independently
    
    Properties of application load balancer:
        1. Operates on OSI layer 7 <-
        2. Routes traffic based on path
        3. Validates and terminates SSL

    Properties of Network load balancer
        1. Operates on OSI layer 4
        2. Routes based on protocol and port of incomeing traffic
        3. SSl passthrough by default

Should you use ALB or NLB 
1. NLB handle spike traffic better
2. NLB exposes static ip address
3. NLB don't support lamda

1. ALB needs global acclertor 
2. ALB support lamda and all
