Design a scalable streaming platform like YouTube or Netflix.
The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and provide seamless video playback with minimal buffering. 
Users should be able to upload, view, and share videos. 
The system should also support features like 
video recommendations, 
user subscriptions, 
and user comments. 

Consider the following requirements:

1. High availability: 
    The system should be highly available, with minimal downtime and the ability to handle failures gracefully.
    
2. Scalability: 
    The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and support a growing user base.

3. Video storage and encoding: 
    Design a scalable and efficient video storage and encoding system to handle the storage and processing of large video files.

4. Content delivery: 
    Implement a content delivery network (CDN) to ensure fast and reliable video streaming to users across different geographical locations.

5. Video transcoding: 
    Support video transcoding to optimize video quality and adapt to different network conditions and device capabilities.

6. User management: 
    Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user accounts and prevent unauthorized access.

7. Recommendation system: 
    Design a recommendation system that suggests personalized video recommendations based on user preferences, viewing history, and other relevant factors.

8. Social features: 
    Implement features like user subscriptions, user comments, and video sharing to enhance user engagement and social interactions.

9. Analytics and monitoring: 
    Design a system to collect and analyze user data, video performance metrics, and system health metrics for monitoring and optimization purposes.

10. Cost optimization:
    Consider cost optimization strategies, such as efficient resource utilization and cloud service selection, to minimize infrastructure costs.

Remember to discuss trade-offs, potential bottlenecks, and how you would handle potential challenges in your design.
