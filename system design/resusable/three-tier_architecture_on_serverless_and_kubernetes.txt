# Three-Tier Architecture on Serverless and Kubernetes

In serverless 
it is already avaliable , we don't need to worry about the scaling and other stuff.

we use 
- API Gateway
- Lambda
- DynamoDB

In Kubernetes
we need to worry about the scaling and other stuff.
we will be deploying the services in the Kubernetes cluster.
and make sure they are present is different Avaliablity Zones.
and also we need to make sure that the services are highly available.
