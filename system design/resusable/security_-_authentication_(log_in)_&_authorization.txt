# Security - Authentication (Log In) & Authorization

Login and Authorization is generally done using IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS.
or else we can use 3rd party services like Auth0, Okta, etc.

it is basically a Authentication service in which client authenticate and sends us a token
and we validate that token and provide the access to the client.

In AWS we can use the following services to authenticate and authorize the users:
1. Cognito
2. IAM
3. SSO
