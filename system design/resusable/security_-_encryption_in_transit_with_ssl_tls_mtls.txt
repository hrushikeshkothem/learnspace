# Security - Encryption In Transit with SSL TLS MTLS

HTTPS is generally called as encryption in transit.

https works with ssl and tls.
ssl stands for secure socket layer.
tls stands for transport layer security.

ssl is the old version and tls is the new version.

working of https: 
1. client sends a request to the server.
2. server sends a certificate to the client.
3. client validates the certificate. using the public key of the server. like certificate Authority (CA).
4. client generates a symmetric key and encrypts the data with the symmetric key.
5. client sends the encrypted data to the server.
6. server decrypts the data with the symmetric key.
7. server sends the response to the client.
8. client decrypts the data with the symmetric key.
9. client sends the response to the server.

MTLS stands for mutual transport layer security.

it is mostly used for b2b services where both the client and server should have a certificate.
