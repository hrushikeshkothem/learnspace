# High Priority Queuing Messaging System

High Priority Queuing Messaging System is a messaging system that allows the user to send messages to other users 
based on the priority of the message.

Let use assume a service A 
    that sends the information of insurence of bike, car and home to process to another service B.

but the client wants to process the insurence of car with high priority than the insurence of bike and home.

in this senario high priority Queuing Messaging System is used.

to implement this system,

implemention 1: 

consider a serivce A that does all the pre-processing and other stuff
and it sends the message to Message Queue (MQ) with the priority of the message.
and the message is processed by the respective service based on the priority of the message.

since the message Queue has the priority of the message, the message is processed based on the priority of the message.

implemention 2:

Service A has a two simple Queue Service (SQS) with the name high_priority and low_priority.


and serivce A sends all the car insurence messages to the high_priority queue 
and bike and home insurence messages to the low_priority queue.

and that queue is processed by the respective service.

implemention 3: 

Service A has a Event Bridge that sends the message to the respective service based on the priority of the message.
